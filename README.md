  <h1>Credit Score Classification</h1>
</p>

At the present time, everyone needs to have good credit because it is seen as a sign of trustworthiness. Financial institutions and credit card issuers use credit scores to determine creditworthiness. It enables banks and credit card companies to issue loans to customers with excellent creditworthiness immediately. 

In today's fast-paced world, doing a manual investigation into each portfolio and generating a credit report both take a significant amount of time. Most of the banks and credit card companies use Machine Learning algorithms to categorize all their customers based on their credit history.

We made a classification system for credit scores to get rid of having to do work by hand. Based on banking data, it is possible to put people into three groups: excellent, standard, and poor. 

We took data from Statso. It is a Data Science Community to Find Case Studies, Datasets and more. This site generates and compiles data from many online sources, and its authors then use this information to develop case studies that show how various types of data can be used to address specific problems.
